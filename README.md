# Sardinas-Patterson Algorithm

The **Sardinas-Patterson algorithm** is a classical method in information theory used to check whether a given set of words forms a **uniquely decodable code**. This repository provides a clean and well-documented implementation of the algorithm in Python (or specify language you used).

## 🔍 Features

- Check whether a given code is **uniquely decodable**
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Clear and efficient implementation
- Easy to extend for research or educational purposes

## 📚 Background

The Sardinas-Patterson algorithm is used to test the unique decodability of variable-length codes, which is crucial in data compression and error-free transmission. It answers the question: "Can every encoded string be uniquely decoded without ambiguity?"

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required *(or list them if used)*

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminhajjari/sardinas-patterson.git
cd sardinas-patterson
